# SelfDrivingCar Simulation using NEAT:
Using NEAT(Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies), a simulated agent learns to drive a car through a series of simple obstacles by Mutating and adopting the 'genotypes' of 'parents'. The environment is set up in such a way where the agent uses multiple copies of itself to explore the environment. The copies that do not progress further are eliminated. This process repeats through a number of generations, until the agent is able to navigate through this environment without hitting the obstacles.
